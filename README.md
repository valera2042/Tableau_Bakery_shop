# Do you need to reorganize your bakery products line?

# Overview 
This interactive dashboard provides you with the information 
about the bakery sales. I found that the bakery products like
bread, pastries, cookies were not the most popular products to sell.
It was the coffee! Interestingly, the coffee to bread sales ratio was more
or less the same throughout the day.
